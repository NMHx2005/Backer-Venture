                <p class="paragraph-3">
                    Backer Venture’s mission is to build the future. We do this by identifying emerging technology
                    trends, partnering with
                    entrepreneurs that are trying to solve some of the world's hardest problems and help them build
                    substantial commercial
                    and economic outcomes. Looking forward, we believe the next decade of technology innovation will
                    create multiple $10T
                    markets. From deep tech, where recent advances in frontier technologies can now be commercialized
                    into sustainable
                    businesses, to life sciences where drug discovery is moving out of the realm of PhDs and chemists
                    into the hands of
                    computer scientists, to the global energy transition where the world’s need for sustainable energy
                    will drive a new
                    waves of innovation, to the creator economy where media and distribution are being disrupted and
                    atomized.

                    <h3>Our story</h3>
                    <p href="" # target="_blank">Social Capital was founded in 2013 by John Philip. Prior to starting
                        Backer Venture, Philip served as an early member of
                        Facebook's senior executive team and led the development and launch of new platforms that drove
                        their global growth.
                        Prior to Facebook, Philip held leading roles at The Mayfield Fund, AOL and Winamp.

                    Such views are as of

                    strategy developed by John
                    Philip, the founder and CEO of Backer Venture, L.L.C. , and used in connection with the SC GP/LP
                    Funds and the
                    Proprietary Capital. "SC GP/LP Funds” refers to the venture capital funds managed by Backer Venture.
                    SC GP/LP Funds are
                    not open to new investors. “Proprietary Capital” refers to investments made by Mr. Palihapitiya
                    starting in 2019 through
                    entities owned and controlled by him and related to the Backer Venture strategy developed by him,
                    other than those made
                    through the SC GP/LP Funds. Proprietary Capital investments are made on an ongoing basis by Mr.
                    Palihapitiya with cash
                    on the balance sheet rather than commitments of limited partners. Backer Venture, including SC GP/LP
                    Funds and
                    Proprietary Capital, is not open to third party investors.</p>
